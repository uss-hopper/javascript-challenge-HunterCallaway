			<p>This World is not Conclusion.<br>
				A Species stands beyond -<br>
				Invisible, as Music -<br>
				But positive, as Sound -<br>
				It beckons, and it baffles -<br>
				Philosophy, dont know -<br>
				And through a Riddle, at the last -<br>
				Sagacity, must go -<br>
				To guess it, puzzles scholars -<br>
				To gain it, Men have borne<br>
				Contempt of Generations<br>
				And Crucifixion, shown -<br>
				Faith slips - and laughs, and rallies -<br>
				Blushes, if any see -<br>
				Plucks at a twig of Evidence -<br>
				And asks a Vane, the way -<br>
				Much Gesture, from the Pulpit -<br>
				Strong Hallelujahs roll -<br>
				Narcotics cannot still the Tooth<br>
				That nibbles at the soul -<br>
				"This World is not Conclusion" by Emily Dickinson (1830-1886)<br>

			<p><em>Mouseover this poem and see what happens.</em><br><br>
				Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>
				Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>
				Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>
				Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>
				Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>
				Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>
				Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>
				The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>
				Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>
				Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>
				The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.<br>
				"Kosmos" by Walt Whitman (1819-1892)
